## Authentication

The application uses token-based authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Authentication state is managed through the `authService` module, which handles:

- User login and registration
- Token storage and management
- Session persistence
- Automatic redirection for protected routes

Authentication flow:
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Token is stored in localStorage
4. Authenticated API requests include the token in the Authorization header
5. Protected routes check authentication status before rendering

## State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management:

- **CartContext**: Manages shopping cart state
- **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state
- **LocationContext**: Manages user location state

Each context provider includes:
- State initialization
- State update methods
- Persistence logic (where applicable)
- Helper functions for derived state

## API Integration

API communication is handled through service modules:

- **apiService**: Base API configuration and request handling
- **authService**: Authentication API requests
- **productService**: Product-related API requests
- **serviceService**: Service-related API requests
- **orderService**: Order-related API requests
- **profileService**: User profile API requests
- **addressService**: Address management API requests

API endpoints follow RESTful conventions:
- GET requests for data retrieval
- POST requests for data creation
- PUT/PATCH requests for data updates
- DELETE requests for data deletion

## Checkout Flow

The checkout process follows a structured flow:

1. **Cart Review**: User reviews items in cart
2. **Authentication**: User must be logged in to proceed
3. **Address Selection**: User selects or adds shipping address
4. **Payment Method**: User selects payment method
5. **Order Review**: User reviews order details
6. **Order Submission**: Order is submitted to the API
7. **Payment Processing**: For credit card payments, user is redirected to payment gateway
8. **Order Confirmation**: User receives confirmation of successful order

## Payment Processing

The application supports multiple payment methods:

- **Credit Card**: Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing
- **Cash on Delivery**: Pay when the order is delivered
- **Bank Transfer**: Manual bank transfer with order reference

Credit card payment flow:
1. Order is created with payment_method="credit_card"
2. API returns a payment_link to the Stripe checkout page
3. User is redirected to the Stripe checkout page
4. After payment, user is redirected to success or failure page
5. Payment verification is performed on the success page
