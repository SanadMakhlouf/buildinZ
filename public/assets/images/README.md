# Hero Background Image

## Instructions:

1. Save your hero background image (the Emirati man using his phone) as `hero-bg.png` in this directory
2. The image should be high quality (at least 1920x1080px) for best results
3. The CSS is already configured to use this image with a dark overlay for better text readability

## Current Setup:
- Background image: `/assets/images/hero-bg.png`
- Overlay: Dark blue overlay (rgba(10, 50, 89, 0.8))
- Background properties: cover, center positioned

The hero section will now use your image as a full-screen background instead of the side image layout.
